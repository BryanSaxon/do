# Python Do

Do replicates the Ruby functionality of `.times do` for Python!

##### Example:

In Ruby:

```ruby
10.times do
  some_method
end
```

In Python with Do:

```python
Do(some_method).times(10)
```

## Installation

TODO

```python
```

## Usage

```python
# Where some method is a defined method (Not method call) and some_int is an
# integer value.
Do(some_method).times(some_int)
```
